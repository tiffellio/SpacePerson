  - Greetings Space Person. Welcome to planet Abel. How may we help you today?
  - We are an ancient and peaceful planet that does not wish harm on others. We maintain
    balance, peace and oneness with the universe. This requires us to protect what
    little resources we have so think carefully with our trade.
  - "Here is our resource proposal\u2026"
