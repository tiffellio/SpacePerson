  dialogue:
  - Come in SpacePerson 3, This is the President of the United World speaking, do
    you read me? Over.
  - "The whole reason we put you up in that shiny new space cruiser 3000 is we need
    resources!  Earth\u2019s dying, and it\u2019s up to YOU to do something about
    it."
  - 'I order you to scour all of the known universe in search of power crystals,
    fresh water, and food. '
  - "Trade with other planets, or perhaps steal their resources if you\u2019re so
    inclined, to get everything our planet needs to survive!"
  - "Our top scientists have determined that 200 units of Crystals, 200 units of
    Water, and 200 units of Trees will be enough to get the world\u2019s ecosystems
    back in order..."
  - AND, you only have 20 days to do it!
  - "In case you run into trouble,  use your onboard laser cannons, press the \u201Cspacebar\u201D.
    Flying is done using the arrow keys. "
  - Good luck SpacePerson 3, your planet is counting on you!
  defaultIntro: Have you returned with good news?
